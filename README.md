# Signal-Processing-on-Acclerometers-for-Inertial-Navigation-System

Localization of an unmanned vehicle, locating it in a three-dimensional space and identifying its acceleration, 
velocity, position and orientation accurately is a very challenging and demanding task. One of the most common systems used for
localization is an Inertial Navigation System, which uses accelerometers and gyroscopes to determine position and
orientation of the body in three-dimensional space. Accelerometers used in an Inertial Motion Unit (IMU) are very
sensitive and susceptible to noise due to vibrations and shocks.  This application aims to enhance reliability and
accuracy and overcome drawbacks of accelerometers in an inertial navigation system.

The attached code uses MPU-6050 for accelerometer readings and it uses a LPC1769 developement board to test the algorithms.
